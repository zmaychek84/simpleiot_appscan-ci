/**
 * TestCase_IOT_MemberTaint
 * <p/>
 * The results of assessing this file should be two input/output stack traces with main as the root.  The first trace
 * uses a member variable of a class to transmit the taint directly. The test passes the taint though a set method and
 * gets it back using a get method.  These differ from the TestCase_IOT_MemberTaint in that they transmit the taint
 * through an output parameter.
 * <p/>
 * Complexity: Hard
