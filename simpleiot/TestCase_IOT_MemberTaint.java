 * TestCase_IOT_MemberTaint
 * <p/>
 * The results of assessing this file should be three input/output stack traces with main as the root.  The first trace
 * uses a member variable of a class to transmit the taint directly. The second test passes the taint through the
 * constructor and gets it back using a get method. The test passes the taint though a set method and gets it back using
 * a get method.
 * <p/>
